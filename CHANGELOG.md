# Changelog

All notable changes to open-media are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.6.5

- Added anime episode stills and synopsis via the id bridge, filling missing artwork and descriptions in the Episodes panel
- Added native kitsu addressing for anime sources, enabling direct resolution without IMDB season arithmetic
- Added bridged-season IMDB queries for anime, querying at the entry's real season instead of flat season 1
- Added OP/ED auto-skip from embedded chapters when AniSkip data is empty, using chapter names like "Opening" or "Credits"
- Added playlist_next behavior, decoupling the mpv Next button from auto-advance so manual episode skipping works even with autoplay off
- Added hold-at-end mode for manual-Next playback, pausing on the last frame and closing after a grace window unless Next is clicked
- Added per-file external subtitle support for appended playlist entries
- Changed episode panel to show series overview as fallback instead of "No synopsis available."
- Fixed multi-line overviews rendering as separate lines in the TUI Details and Episode panels
- Fixed inline HTML tags and entities in AniList descriptions being displayed literally in the TUI
- Fixed Fribb anime-list schema change that broke anime debrid sources by accepting both legacy and current data shapes
- Fixed failed bridge loads being memoized forever, now retrying after a 120s cooldown

## 0.6.4

- Added MAL OAuth PKCE login with automatic token refresh for persistent authentication.
- Added TorBox as a new debrid provider alongside Real-Debrid.

## 0.6.3

- Added mouse support to the TUI.

## 0.6.2

- Added local watchlist tracking
- Added support for mpv playlist next episode playback
- Added opt-in mpv thumbnail preview support
- Stream search results into the TUI for faster browsing
- Improved the TUI library and overall browsing experience

## 0.6.1

- Fixed the `--version` output to display "open-media" instead of "om".

## 0.6.0

### Changed
- **Published to crates.io.** All `open-media-*` crates (the libraries and the
  `open-media-cli` binary) are now published to crates.io under the `grok-insider`
  account, so they can be consumed as normal registry dependencies and the binary
  installed with `cargo install open-media-cli`. GitHub Releases (prebuilt
  binaries) and the cachix cache remain as additional delivery channels. release-plz
  now publishes each crate in dependency order on release.

## 0.5.0

### Added
- **Anime episode titles** — AniList anime episodes now show real titles
  (e.g. `Frieren - S01E01 - The Journey's End`) fetched from Jikan
  (`/v4/anime/{mal}/episodes`), falling back to AniList `streamingEpisodes`.
  Best-effort; surfaces in the episode list, the mpv window title, and Discord.
- **Open the TUI pre-filled** — `open-media "<query>"` (a positional argument)
  opens the TUI and immediately runs the search.
- **Real tracker in the Provider column** — keyless Torrentio results now parse
  the actual sub-tracker (1337x/RARBG/YTS/…) from the release title instead of
  showing a flat "Torrentio", so the Sources Provider filter is useful without a
  debrid token.
- **AniList/MAL → IMDB bridge** — anime are bridged to an IMDB id (via Fribb's
  anime-lists, fetched and cached) so Torrentio/Real-Debrid cached sources light
  up for anime, not just nyaa. Coverage is partial (mostly anime movies and a
  subset of series); unmapped titles keep their nyaa sources unchanged.
- **MSRV CI** — a dedicated `cargo check` job on Rust 1.82 verifies the declared
  minimum supported version.

### Changed
- **Robustness** — a shared `open-media-net` HTTP client with connect/request
  timeouts replaces bare `reqwest::Client::new()` across every adapter, plus a
  bounded exponential-backoff retry helper on the transient (network/timeout)
  paths. Playback now fails over to the next ranked source candidate when the
  chosen one can't be resolved (above the existing debrid→P2P fallback), and a
  binge no longer aborts on a single failed episode.

### Fixed
- Singular `Season N-M` batch releases are parsed as a season range (previously
  only the plural `Seasons 1-5` / `S01-S05` forms were), while keeping
  `Season 2 - 01` as season 2 episode 1.

## 0.4.0

### Changed
- Renamed the crates, binary, and library names from `om*`/`om-*` to
  `open-media` / `open-media-*` (and the subtitle engine `os-*` →
  `open-subtitle-*`). No behavioral change.

## 0.3.0

### Added
- **Subtitles** — auto-fetch subtitles into the player via an `open-subtitle`
  engine integration. A new `SubtitleProvider` port (`om-core`) and `om-subs`
  adapter search by title + season/episode, write the best match to a temp file,
  and load it into mpv/vlc (`--sub-file`). Opt-in via `[subtitles]`
  (`enabled = false` by default, `languages = ["en"]`).
- **`om login anilist`** — obtain an AniList token via a loopback OAuth flow
  (implicit grant; no client secret), saved to the config for progress tracking.
- **Binge / auto-advance** — after an episode completes, optionally advance to the
  next one (`behavior.autoplay_next`), skipping filler/recap when `skip_filler`
  is set (consults the AniSkip/Jikan enricher).
- **Search pagination** — TMDB and AniList now return more than one page of
  results.
- **Anime absolute episode numbering** — match continuously-numbered sequels
  (e.g. an S2E01 released as `… - 21`) via AniList prequel offsets and a
  nyaa absolute-number fetch.
- **Configurable TUI theme** — `ui.theme` (`dark`/`light`/`auto`) is now applied
  instead of hardcoded colors.
- **Wider `om config set` / `show`** — setters for the full key set with typed
  parsing; `config show` prints all loaded keys (secrets masked).
- Configurable nyaa category (`providers.nyaa_category`).

### Fixed
- AniList movies are no longer mis-modeled as episodic (`format: MOVIE` → movie).
- Currently-airing anime derive their episode count from `nextAiringEpisode`
  instead of yielding an empty list.
- `Engine::details` merges cross-provider ids instead of dropping them.
- `behavior.resume` is honored (skip the start-seek when disabled; progress is
  still recorded).
- `OPEN_MEDIA_*` environment overrides are applied on config load.
- Cached debrid sources get a small unconditional score tiebreak.
- MAL sets `is_rewatching` for a repeating status.
- vlc honors the resume position (`--start-time`).
- The P2P engine no longer holds its state lock across the metadata wait.
- Real episode runtime is passed to AniSkip when known.
- Release-tag parsing nits (bit-depth, multi-audio, provider guard, `[AD+]`/
  `[PM+]`/`[TB+]` cache flags, `GiB`).

### Internal
- A `dev` integration branch now gates merges into `master` (CI guard), and the
  release pipeline is hardened (network-resilient release-plz). Note: the
  `release-plz` PR job is non-blocking because the git-dependent `om-subs` crate
  can't be packaged by release-plz's change detection (upstream
  release-plz/release-plz#2789); releases are cut from a manual version bump.

## 0.2.0

- Added Windows support for mpv interaction and Discord Rich Presence.
- Added prebuilt binaries for Linux (x86_64 and aarch64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added — Phase 10: packaging (Nix flake + cachix CI)
- `flake.nix`: `packages.x86_64-linux.{om,default}` via `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`
  (cmake + bindgenHook for aws-lc-sys + bundled rusqlite; no OpenSSL/system sqlite;
  webpki-roots ⇒ no ca-certificates), `homeManagerModules.default`
  (`programs.open-media`), `devShells.default`, and `nixConfig` for the grok-insider
  cachix cache. Secrets stay out of the store (config via `om init`); mpv is a
  documented runtime dep.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `rust` job (fmt + clippy `-D warnings` + tests) on
  every push/PR; `build` job (master/tags/dispatch) builds `om` with Nix and
  pushes the closure to `grok-insider.cachix.org`.
- Published to `github:grok-insider/open-media`; wired into the NixOS host so `rebuild`
  installs `om` from cache. `nix build .#om` + `nix flake check` verified.

### Added — keyless metadata + UX
- **Cinemeta metadata (`om-metadata`)**: new keyless, IMDB-native `CinemetaProvider`
  (Stremio `v3-cinemeta.strem.io`) for movies and live-action series. It is wired
  on by default (`providers.cinemeta`), so **search works with no TMDB key** —
  `om search "breaking bad"` now returns results out of the box. TMDB stays as an
  optional richer source when a key is set; results are de-duplicated by IMDB id.
- **Season navigation (`om-cli` TUI)**: a Seasons screen plus real per-season
  episode lists fetched from the metadata provider; multi-season series are now
  fully browsable (previously only season 1, with a fabricated 12-episode list).
- **Sources filter/sort panel (`om-cli` TUI)**: a focusable right-hand panel
  (`Tab` to focus, `j/k` + `←/→` to adjust) to sort by relevance/seeders/quality/
  size and filter by quality, language, provider, and cached-only, with a live
  Details box for the highlighted release. Rows are now one scannable line each.
  Selections persist to `[ui.sources]` in `config.toml`.
- **Accurate player titles (`om-core::title`)**: mpv's `--force-media-title` (and
  Discord presence) now read `Series - S01E01 - Episode Title` (degrading to
  `Series - S01E01`, or `Movie (Year)`), via a shared pure title helper. The
  selected episode's title is threaded through `PlayRequest`.

### Fixed
- **Real-Debrid multi-file playback (`om-debrid`)**: a season pack now unrestricts
  the *requested* episode. RD's `links` array is indexed per *selected* file, not
  per full-torrent file; the resolver maps the candidate's file index correctly
  and labels the stream with the real file name.
- **Resolver cache-gating (`om-stream`)**: `HybridResolver` no longer forces a slow
  add→download→unrestrict warm-up for *uncached* candidates when P2P can stream
  them, and now falls back to P2P if a debrid resolve fails.
- **Torrentio for anime (`om-sources`)**: returns empty (instead of erroring) for
  titles with no IMDB id, so AniList anime cleanly fall through to nyaa.
- **Dead config key (`om-cli`)**: `behavior.complete_threshold` is now passed to the
  engine (previously always the hard-coded 0.85).
- **Debrid gating consistency (`om-cli`)**: the `realdebrid=` Torrentio parameter is
  only injected when Real-Debrid is the active backend, matching the provider
  wiring (`Config::has_real_debrid`).
- Removed the outdated "metadata adapters are stubbed until Phase 1" message and
  stale `[Phase 8]`/"Phase 4" doc comments.

### Added — Phases 4–9: streaming, players, session, history, tracking, TUI
- **P2P streaming (`om-stream`)**: `P2pEngine` over librqbit (rust-tls + http-api,
  no system OpenSSL) — magnet → metadata → largest video file → librqbit's
  Range-aware stream URL; `HybridResolver` made functional. Live-streamed Sintel
  in ~2.5s via real peers.
- **Players (`om-player`)**: `MpvPlayer` (launch + JSON-IPC `PlaybackControl`:
  seek/position/duration/pause/chapters/quit) and `VlcPlayer` (launch-only).
  Verified against real mpv 0.41.
- **Orchestration (`om-app` `Engine::play`)**: resolve → resume → enrich → launch →
  IPC monitor (auto-skip OP/ED on the 2s trigger, ~1 Hz progress persistence,
  Discord presence, chapters) cancelled by player exit via `select!` → teardown →
  completion → tracker update. `Engine::details`/`resolve` use-cases; `om play`
  wired to the full flow.
- **History (`om-history`)**: `SqliteHistory` (rusqlite bundled) — upserting
  progress, resume, recents; persists across reopen.
- **Tracking/enrich/presence (`om-track`)**: AniSkip (OP/ED by MAL) + Jikan filler;
  AniList (GraphQL) + MAL (REST) trackers + composite fan-out; Discord rich
  presence over real IPC framing (best-effort).
- **TUI (`om-cli`)**: ratatui interactive app (Search → Results → Episodes →
  Sources → play) with an `mpsc` render loop; logs routed off the alternate
  screen. Verified end-to-end with Wisp: live AniList search → 28 episodes → 43
  ranked nyaa sources.
- **Live validation**: Real-Debrid (premium account + 88 cached Torrentio direct
  URLs), real-mpv IPC, live P2P (Sintel), and the full TUI flow — all confirmed.
  Live/real-binary tests are gated `#[ignore]` + env so CI stays hermetic.
- **Tests**: 63 hermetic (unit + wiremock e2e + composition-root e2e) green;
  `cargo clippy -D warnings` clean.

### Added — Phases 1–3: discovery → resolve pipeline (implemented + tested)
- **Metadata (`om-metadata`)**: real `TmdbProvider` (movie/tv/multi search,
  details with IMDB hydration, seasons, episodes) and `AniListProvider` (GraphQL
  anime search/details with AniList+MAL ids). Errors mapped to `CoreError`.
- **Sources (`om-sources`)**: `TorrentioSource` (cache-aware streams, direct URLs
  + infohashes) and `NyaaSource` (namespace-robust RSS via quick-xml), plus a
  ported, unit-tested release-tag parser (quality/HDR/codec/audio/language/size).
- **Debrid (`om-debrid`)**: `RealDebrid` with the full
  add→poll→select→poll→unrestrict flow, account summary, and Auth/Remote/Timeout
  error mapping.
- **Resolver (`om-stream`)**: `HybridResolver` now functional — cached/direct →
  addon URL, otherwise → debrid `resolve_playback`, else P2P (Phase 4 stub).
- **App (`om-app`)**: `Engine::search`/`find_sources` parallelized with
  `futures::join_all`; added `Engine::details` and `Engine::resolve` use-cases.
- **Testing**: every network adapter ships unit tests + wiremock-based e2e
  integration tests, plus a composition-root e2e (`om-cli/tests/pipeline_e2e.rs`)
  that drives the whole search→details→sources→resolve pipeline (both the
  cached-direct and uncached-via-Real-Debrid branches) through the real `Engine`.
  **41 tests** total (16 unit + 25 integration/e2e); `cargo clippy -D warnings`
  clean.

### Added — Phase 0: scaffold & docs
- Cargo workspace with 11 `om-*` crates and an enforced ports-and-adapters
  dependency rule (hexagonal architecture).
- `om-core`: domain model (`Media`, `Episode`, `SourceCandidate`, `Playback`,
  `IdSet`, …), the full set of port traits (`MetadataProvider`, `SourceProvider`,
  `DebridProvider`, `StreamResolver`, `Player`/`PlaybackControl`, `Tracker`,
  `Enricher`, `HistoryStore`, `PresenceReporter`), a unified `CoreError`, and
  pure, unit-tested candidate scoring.
- `om-config`: TOML config schema, load/save, XDG paths, and a secrets policy
  (tokens live only in the user config file, never in code/repo/logs).
- Adapter crates (`om-metadata`, `om-sources`, `om-debrid`, `om-stream`,
  `om-player`, `om-track`, `om-history`) as contract-verified stubs — each
  implements its port returning `NotImplemented`, so the whole interface compiles.
- A real `CompositeTracker` (dual-write fan-out) in `om-track`.
- `om-app`: the `Engine` + `EngineBuilder` with working `search`/`find_sources`
  fan-out and ranking, depending only on `om-core` (tested with fake ports).
- `om-cli`: the `om` binary with `init`, `config {show,path,set}`, `search`, and
  `play` (scaffold), plus the composition root (`compose.rs`).
- Documentation: `README`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/RESEARCH.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `future-features.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, MIT `LICENSE`.

### Notes
- The full discover → source → resolve → play pipeline is implemented and tested
  (Phases 1–9); network adapters are real, not stubs. Remaining work is packaging
  and polish — see `docs/PLAN.md`.
